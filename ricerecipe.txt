Follow These Steps
Boil water and add salt
After you rinse your rice, pour fresh water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon salt into the water.
Pour in rice
Add the rice to the boiling water.
Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice
Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.
Cover the pot and simmer
Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.
Fluff rice with a fork
Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice, might we suggest some chili to go with it?
